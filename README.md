# get-high

Project name is subject to change.

Somebody edit this README.

## API Playground

[DEMO](http://get-high.herokuapp.com) can be used to test and explore some of the APIs.

[Logger](http://get-high.herokuapp.com/logger) can be used to track server connections in real time for a better testing purpose. *more logs can ben added upon requests*

## Code Style and Conventions

Please follow the [Git commit message conventions](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for better unified developing experiences.

## Technology and Platform

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is a full-stack NodeJS platform that can be used to build both front-end and back-end web-apps as well as mobile apps (through [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)). Before the release of version 1.3, it is recommend to write **front-end templates with Blaze** (provided by meteor). With the 1.3 upgrade, meteor now supports **Angular and React natively**, ionic (web technologies on mobile apps) works natively with angular.

**Here we will only use it for back-end services** because later on our web app can be easily adopted with the same codebase.

[DDP](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/ddp/DDP.md) is a protocol between a lient and a server that uses either SockJS or WebSockets as a lower-level message transport. DDP messages are JSON objects.

**We will use DDP for client server communication** since its native for meteor and really easy to implement.

## Configurations

**CRITICAL** configurations need to be established before clients can be connected!!

### Google

Scope (Permission) - list can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes)
* CalenderAPI
* offlineToken

Client Credentials - need to be obtained before using google apis, credentials can be added [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=get-high) *additional app owner can be added upon requests*
